# Reminder: For compatibility, Git convention default line endings for object database must be LF.

# Detect all text files and convert CRLF to LF when writing to object database.
* text=auto

# By default core.eol is set to native and should not be changed (to check if changed the command 'git config --global core.eol' should return nothing). 
# It means that writing out to the working dir. is done according to your platform (CRLF for Windows and LF for Unix/OS X). 
# So if you're on Windows and you use an operation like git clone/git checkout, you'll have CRLF line endings into your working dir.
# But if you want some files to keep LF line endings you have to make an exception. 
# Here shell files are written out to the working dir. with LF no matter what the platform is.
